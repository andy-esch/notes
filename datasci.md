## Questions

### p-value

* What is p-value?
* Give a basic example of p-value?
* How is p-value flawed?

### Goodness of fit

* What is R^2?
* Can R^2 be negative?

### GLM

* Explain GLM

### Classification

* What are ways to deal with unbalanced classes?
* Explain F1 Score

### Random Forest

* Explain how Random Forest works.
* What are the hyper parameters for random forest?

### Grandient Boosting

* Explain how gradient boosting works.
* What are the hyper parameters for grandient boosting?

### Bayes' Theorem

* Explain Bayes' Theorem

  P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A) / P(B)

### Core Concepts

* Explain the variance / bias tradeoff.

   A goal of modeling is for the model to learn from the data. If a model is too
   complex (e.g., has too many degrees of freedom), it gets to a point where it has
   learned all of the reducible error and it starts to learn from the irreducible
   error of the model (the noise). At this point the model formally becomes 'overfit'.
   If the model is 
   If we were to look at the loss of the test MSE, 
   MSE, the 
   Train MSE
   Test MSE

## Skills I want to develop
